## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze hospital emergency room performance. It converts raw patient-level data into structured insights to support operational monitoring and data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard enables users to evaluate patient flow, waiting time, admissions, demographics, and departmental workload in a single consolidated view.
